# tec-STM scanning tunneling microscope

this STM project is easier to achive than the https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-SEM

Certainly! I'll combine the previous code with the new implementation, fill in missing parts, and create a more comprehensive STM Controller program in MINT 2.0. 




This comprehensive STM Controller program in MINT 2.0 combines elements from both versions and fills in missing parts. Here's a summary of the changes and additions:

1. Constants: Added a CONSTANTS function to define important constants used throughout the program.

2. Variables: Initialized all necessary variables in the SETUP function.

3. ENGAGE_SCANNER: Modified to use MEASURE_CURRENT and compare with SETPOINT.

4. MOVE_MOTOR: Added a placeholder function for motor movement.

5. IV_CURVE: Implemented the I-V curve sweep, including DAC output for bias voltage.

6. RETRACT_Z: Implemented Z-piezo retraction.

7. PID_CONTROL: Kept as is, now integrated with MOVE_Z_PIEZO.

8. SCAN: Implemented full scanning functionality, including X and Y movement.

9. MEASURE_CURRENT: Added ADC reading logic with busy-wait.

10. MOVE_X_PIEZO, MOVE_Y_PIEZO, MOVE_Z_PIEZO: Implemented DAC output for each axis.

11. WRITE_DAC: Added basic SPI communication logic for DAC.

12. WAIT_TIME_STEP: Implemented a simple delay function.

13. IDLE_FUNCTIONS: Added placeholder for operations during idle time.

This implementation provides a more complete framework for the STM Controller. However, there are still some areas that may need further development or customization:

1. SPI Communication: The actual SPI communication for DAC and ADC needs to be implemented based on your specific hardware.

2. Data Recording: The RECORD_Z_POSITION and RECORD_CURRENT_VOLTAGE functions need to be expanded to handle actual data storage.

3. Serial Communication: The SEND_LINE_DATA function needs to be implemented with your specific serial communication protocol.

4. Error Handling: Additional error checking and handling could be added to make the system more robust.

5. User Interface: Depending on your setup, you might want to add functions for user input and control, either through serial commands or other input methods.

6. Optimization: Depending on the performance requirements, some functions might need optimization for speed or memory usage.

This code provides a solid foundation for an STM Controller in MINT 2.0. You can further refine and expand this code based on your specific hardware setup and requirements.
